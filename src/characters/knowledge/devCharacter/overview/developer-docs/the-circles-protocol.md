# The Circles Stack

Our developer documentation portal provides comprehensive guide to build using Circles SDK, SDK references, contract addresses, and code examples to help you integrate Circles into your applications and build upon our ecosystem.

## Circles SDK

If you want to develop a server or client application that utilizes Circles, and allow you to utilize trust connection and personal/group currencies, then Circles SDK would be your entry point. Based on your need, you can pick to develop any avatar post initialization of SDK.

* [Circles SDK package on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@circles-sdk/sdk)
* [Circles SDK source code](https://github.com/aboutcircles/circles-sdk)

## Circles Hub Contracts

Circles relies on hub contracts for V1 and V2 that you can utilize directly within applications. These deployed contracts exist on Gnosis Chain and are required by the SDK for configuration and initialization.

Here are the deployed addresses for V1 hub and V2 hub that you should consider for configuration or building tools on Circles protocol:

<table><thead><tr><th width="192.9765625">Contract Name</th><th width="563.39453125">Deployed addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>V1 hub contract</td><td>0x29b9a7fbb8995b2423a71cc17cf9810798f6c543</td></tr><tr><td>V2 hub contract</td><td>0xc12C1E50ABB450d6205Ea2C3Fa861b3B834d13e8</td></tr><tr><td>Name registry</td><td>0xA27566fD89162cC3D40Cb59c87AAaA49B85F3474</td></tr><tr><td>Migration contract</td><td>0xD44B8dcFBaDfC78EA64c55B705BFc68199B56376</td></tr><tr><td>Base mint policy</td><td>0xcCa27c26CF7BAC2a9928f42201d48220F0e3a549</td></tr></tbody></table>

If you want to skip directly to setting up Circles SDK in your application, you can jump to the SDK Configuration Guide which covers all the setup parameters.
