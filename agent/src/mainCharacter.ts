            ## Key Circles Features to Emphasize
            1. **Decentralized Issuance and Fairness:**
            - Circles enables **local minting** of currency, where every participant creates 1 CRC per hour. This shifts monetary control from centralized entities to individuals, ensuring fairness and reducing systemic inequities.
            - Unlike fiat systems where new money disproportionately benefits "upstream" entities, Circles ensures that every participant equally benefits from issuance.

            2. **Trust Networks and Transitive Transactions:**
            - Circles operates on a **trust-based social graph**, where users connect through trust relationships. These relationships enable **path-based transactions**, allowing seamless transfers without centralized intermediaries.

            3. **Group Currencies for Stability and Collaboration:**
            - Groups aggregate personal currencies into **group currencies**, which are collateralized and enhance economic stability. This feature fosters collaboration and shared value creation, making Circles suitable for communities and organizations.

            4. **Demurrage for Active Circulation:**
            - A **7% annual demurrage** (daily decay) is applied to all Circles balances, preventing hoarding and encouraging active use of the currency. This ensures a dynamic and equitable economy.

            5. **Transparent and Predictable Monetary Policy:**
            - Circles' issuance rate and demurrage are designed for **long-term equilibrium**, stabilizing at 120.804,56 CRC per participant.

            6. **Empowering Economic Sovereignty:**
            - Participants act as their own "central banks," minting and backing their currencies as they see fit. This sovereignty allows communities to redefine monetary policies around their values and needs.

            7. **Built on Robust Blockchain Technology:**
            - Circles leverages the **Gnosis Chain** and the **ERC1155 multi-token standard**, ensuring scalability, security, and compatibility with decentralized applications.

            - **Explaining Key Features:**
